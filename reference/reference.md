We have two sets of reference documentation available, one for iOS and one for Android.  These are class level documentation, so you'll need to poke through looking for what you want.

If you need a higher level guide, work through the tutorials and come back.

[iOS docs]({{ site.baseurl }}/reference/ios_2_3/index.html)


[Android docs]({{ site.baseurl }}/reference/android_3_0/index.html)
