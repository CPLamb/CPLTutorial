## WhirlyGlobe-Maply for iOS and Android



Based on OpenGL ES and focused on mobile first, WhirlyGlobe-Maply is used in a wide variety of altas, weather, visualization, and map apps.

The full feature is pretty list long, but here are a few things you can display with the toolkit.

- Giant networked image basemaps
- Animated weather data
- Labels, both 2D and 3D
- Markers, likewise 2D and 3D
- Floating annotations
- Vectors, outlined and filled
- Lofted polygons
- Tiled vector maps

It's big, but it's also friendly.  We present the native interface on each platform and we've got some nice tutorials.  Developers of all skill levels have made WhirlyGlobe-Maply apps.  You can too!

### Videos

Check out what the toolkit can do.  Here are a couple of short videos showing off the globe and the map, respectively.

### iPhone and iPad

The toolkit started on iOS and that's the most mature platform.  The released version is 2.3 and the develop branch contains 2.4 at the moment.

We do deep, dark things with OpenGL ES and C++ in the core.  But you don't see any of that!  The interface is Objective-C and used easily in Swift as well.

### Android

We've been busy porting to Android!  So far it's just Maply (2D slippy map), but the globe can't be far behind.  Look for version 3.0 in the source tree and give it a try.

Is this a terrible C++ port to Android?  No!  We hide all that NDK stuff and provide a nice, clean Java interface.
