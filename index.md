## Documentation and Resources

There's a [getting started]({{ site.baseurl }}/tutorial/getting_started.html) guide. I suggest you get started there.

Reference documentation is also [there]({{ site.baseurl }}/reference/reference.html). Best to use if you're in the middle of development.

Please join the [mailing list](http://eepurl.com/D30CD) for very infrequent announcements.

Check out the [mousebird consulting blog](http://mousebirdconsulting.blogspot.com) for technical discussion.
