## WhirlyGlobe-Maply for iOS and Android

Based on OpenGL ES and focused on mobile first, WhirlyGlobe-Maply is used in a wide variety of altas, weather, visualization, and map apps.
The feature list is pretty long, but here are a few things you can display with the toolkit.

- Giant networked image basemaps
- Animated weather data
- Labels, both 2D and 3D
- Markers, likewise 2D and 3D
- Floating annotations
- Vectors, outlined and filled
- Lofted polygons
- Tiled vector maps

It's big, but it's also friendly.  You develop with the native tools on each platform and we've got some nice tutorials.  Developers of all skill levels have made WhirlyGlobe-Maply apps.  You can too!

The iOS version, for iPhone and Android is the most mature.  Android is coming along nicely with Maply ported first.

## Videos

Check out what the toolkit can do.  Here are a couple of short videos showing off the globe and the map, respectively.

## Documentation and Resources

There's a [getting started]({{ site.baseurl }}/tutorial/getting_started.html) guide. I suggest you get started there.

Reference documentation is also [there]({{ site.baseurl }}/reference/reference.html). Best to use if you're in the middle of development.

Please join the [mailing list](http://eepurl.com/D30CD) for very infrequent announcements.

Check out the [mousebird consulting blog](http://mousebirdconsulting.blogspot.com) for technical discussion.
