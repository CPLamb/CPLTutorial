title: Getting Started With WhirlyGlobe-Maply
layout: tutorial
---

WhirlyGlobe-Maply is an open source toolkit for iOS and Android. You can use it to build an interactive 2D map (Maply) or a 3D rotating globe (WhirlyGlobe).  If you haven’t checked out the main [project page](http://mousebird.github.io/WhirlyGlobe/), you should at least watch the videos before continuing.

This document will walk you through the necessary steps to get started with WhirlyGlobe-­Maply. At the end you will have written a simple globe ­based app and/or a simple map based app. The finished projects are available for reference on github <here>, but working through these examples yourself, particularly if you are new to WG-­Maply, is recommended.

A brief note on style: there are many instances in which you will need to enter project settings, code, or commands in the Terminal application verbatim. In each case, the exact text required will be noted in a fixed­width font, like so.

## Pre-requisites

You should be familiar with the Terminal in OS X.  You’ll need to type a number of commands to get started.

Some familiarity with git is helpful.  We make use of [git](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)) and [github](http://github.com/).

You’ll also need to use [Xcode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xcode) to compile and edit your source code.

Xcode 5.1 and WG­-Maply 2.3 were used to prepare this guide. If you're using a newer version of either Xcode or WG-­Maply, there may be minor changes required.

## WhirlyGlobe-Maply Distributions

There are two ways to access the WhirlyGlobe-Maply library.  You can get all the source code or you can use a binary distribution.  We’ll show you how to do both here, so choose the one you’re most comfortable with.  Both lead to the next step, building a test app.

To get started, choose your approach.
