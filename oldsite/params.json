The latter is built on top of the former, as you might expect\r\n\r\nYou probably want the Component.  It's a framework that lets you add an interactive 3D globe to your iPad or iPhone app.  The interface is entirely Objective-C and it's pretty easy to use.\r\n\r\nTo get the WhirlyGlobe Component, just head on over to the downloads area and grab the latest:\r\nhttps://github.com/mousebird/WhirlyGlobe/downloads\r\n\r\nIf you want to know more about the WhirlyGlobe Component, check out the announcement:\r\nhttp://mousebirdconsulting.blogspot.com/2012/08/whirlyglobe-component-announcement.html\r\n\r\nIf you need to dig a bit deeper then take a look at the WhirlyGlobe API.  Just clone the repository and use the master branch.  You'll need a whole mess of support libraries as well.  Look at the notes file under WhirlyGlobeLib for details.\r\n\r\nThe old WhirlyGlobe 1.2 repo can be found on google code:\r\nhttps://code.google.com/p/whirlyglobe/\r\n\r\nWhat is WhirlyGlobe?\r\n---\r\n\r\nWhirlyGlobe is a self contained 3D earth display view suitable for use in iPhone and iPad applications. The globe is rendered in OpenGL ES with a pageable quad tree texture and support for vector data overlays. It is intended as a (relatively) lightweight widget that can be dropped in to your app to do simple data overlay and interaction with a globe. It can also do more heavy duty data interaction if you want to use it as the centerpiece for a globe based app.\r\n","google":""}
