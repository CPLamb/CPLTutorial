You need to create an Xcode project.  We’ll call it **HelloEarth** and you’ll add all your tutorial code to it.

Open Xcode, select File, New, and then Project.  Use the Single View Application Template.

![Single View Application]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/tutorial/hello_earth_template.png)

Call your new app HelloEarth.  You can leave the rest as defaults.

For source control, check the Source Control box to create a local git repository for your project.  You’ll need this if you set up the project with git submodules below.

Done? Good. Close Xcode and let's modify the project to pull in WG-Maply.


### WhirlyGlobe-Maply Distributions

We distribute the WhirlyGlobe-Maply library in three ways. Any one of them is fine.  Pick the one you are most familiar with.  Don’t care?  Try binary.

* [Building from Source](building_from_source.html) - Use submodules for the distribution on github.
* [Build from binary](building_from_binary.html) - The self contained binary distribution.
* [Build with CocoaPods](building_from_cocoapod.html) - Use the WG-Maply CocoaPod.

It’s like a pick your own adventure book, but boring.  So just like a pick your own adventure book.
