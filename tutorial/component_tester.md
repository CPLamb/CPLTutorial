The tutorials provide simple examples for much WhirlyGlobe-Maply functionality.  We can't cover everything or maybe we just don't have the time.  But odds are we have tested a given piece of functionality and there's one place to find it.

I give you: The WhirlyGlobe-Maply Component Tester!

Turning on every single feature in the app is... colorful.

### Component Tester Source

The component tester app is the central location for trying things out.  Most WhirlyGlobe-Maply features are represented in there somewhere.  And you already have it.

Look in _libs/WhirlyGlobeMaply/WhirlyGlobeSrc/WhirlyGlobeComponentTester_ or just search for _WhirlyGlobeComponentTester_.  That's the project and the main file is TestViewController.m.  Open that up and poke around.  Make some changes.  See what happens.

Be sure to consult the reference docs when you need them.  If you get stuck, drop us an email.  And happy coding!
