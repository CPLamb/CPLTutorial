Let's check out some of WG-­Maply's capabilities.  The toolkit comes with a test app that runs through the really interesting ones.  It's included with the source you cloned from github.

In libs/WhirlyGlobe-Maply/WhirlyGlobeSrc, open the WhirlyGlobeComponentTester project. Build and run it, preferably on some good hardware. Fool around with the various display options, and you'll get a taste of how capable WG-­Maply is.

Spending a few minutes with WhirlyGlobeComponentTester will familiarize you with many of the toolkit’s capabilities. Over the next few sections we'll use some of those ourselves, and show you how to build a simple app with a globe or a flat map that displays the world, shows country outlines, and responds to taps and selections. After that, hopefully you'll be comfortable browsing through the [WG-Maply documentation](http://mousebird.github.io/WhirlyGlobe/documentation/2_3/) and the WhirlyGlobeComponentTester source for ideas of what to try next.
