Displaying data is one thing, but we'd also like to touch it.  WhirlyGlobe-Maply has a wealth of interactive features.  Let's start with selection and annotations.

You'll need to have done the [Vector Data](adding_vector_data.html) tutorial.  Open your HelloEarth project and get ready.

![Xcode ViewController.m]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/tutorial/vector_selection_1.png)

If you haven't got one here is a suitable [ViewController.m]({{ site.baseurl }}/tutorial/code/ViewController_vector_selection.m) file to start with.  This version handles both a globe and a map and makes a nice starting point.

Let's start with annotations.

### Annotations

A <a href= "{{ site.baseurl }}/reference/ios_2_3/Classes/MaplyAnnotation.html" target="_blank">MaplyAnnotation</a> is a little <a href= "https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/uikit/reference/UIView_Class/index.html" target="_blank">UIView</a> that you place at a geo location.  It will follow that location on the map or globe as the user moves around.

We'll create one of these annotations where the user taps or selects a country.  Let's start with the addAnnotation method.

Open ViewController.m. Add a new private method in the _@interface_ section to create an annotation with a given title, subtitle, and location.  We can use this with both map and globe.

{% highlight objc %}
­- (void) addAnnotation:(NSString *)title withSubtitle:(NSString *)subtitle at: (MaplyCoordinate)coord;
{% endhighlight %}

Now, fill that method in.

{% highlight objc %}
­- (void)addAnnotation:(NSString *)title withSubtitle:(NSString *)subtitle at:(MaplyCoordinate)coord
{
    [theViewC clearAnnotations];

    MaplyAnnotation *annotation = [[MaplyAnnotation alloc] init];
    annotation.title = title;
    annotation.subTitle = subtitle;
    [theViewC addAnnotation:annotation forPoint:coord offset:CGPointZero];
}
{% endhighlight %}

That will add an annotation at a given point, but we still need to wire up tapping and selection.

### Delegates for Tapping

To get taps and selection we need to fill in either the <a href= "{{ site.baseurl }}/reference/ios_2_3/Protocols/MaplyViewControllerDelegate.html" target="_blank">WhirlyGlobeViewControllerDelegate protocol</a> (for globes), or the <a href= "{{ site.baseurl }}/reference/ios_2_3/Protocols/WhirlyGlobeViewControllerDelegate.html" target="_blank">MaplyViewControllerDelegate protocol</a> (for maps).  We assign ourselves as a delegate and implement any tap or selection methods we're interested in. Let's try taps first.

We're going to pop up a little annotation to show where the user tapped.

Open up ViewController.h. Modify the ViewController interface to include the two protocols. (There's no harm in doing so, all the methods are optional.)

{% highlight objc %}
@interface ViewController : UIViewController 
                <WhirlyGlobeViewControllerDelegate,MaplyViewControllerDelegate>
{% endhighlight %}

Set your map or view controller's delegate.  This will work if you have either map or globe.

{% highlight objc %}
// If you're doing a globe
if (globeViewC != nil)
    globeViewC.delegate = self;

// If you're doing a map
if (mapViewC != nil)
    mapViewC.delegate = self;
{% endhighlight %}

Tapping and selection differ between the map and globe.  We'll fill in both delegates like so.


{% highlight objc %}
­- (void)globeViewController:(WhirlyGlobeViewController *)viewC 
                            didTapAt:(MaplyCoordinate)coord
{
  NSString *title = @"Tap Location:";
  NSString *subtitle = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"(%.2fN, %.2fE)", 
                        coord.y*57.296,coord.x*57.296];
  [self addAnnotation:title withSubtitle:subtitle at:coord];
}

- (void)maplyViewController:(MaplyViewController *)viewC 
                            didTapAt:(MaplyCoordinate)coord
{
  NSString *title = @"Tap Location:";
  NSString *subtitle = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"(%.2fN, %.2fE)", 
                        coord.y*57.296,coord.x*57.296];
  [self addAnnotation:title withSubtitle:subtitle at:coord];
}
{% endhighlight %}

That's it! Build and run, and each time you tap (outside a vector), an annotation will appear at the tapped location indicating its _latitude_ and _longitude_.

### Delegates for Selection

WhirlyGlobe-Maply will do all the work for feature selection.  You just have to tell it you're interested.  That's what the following delegate methods will do.  Add these in ViewController.m

{% highlight objc %}

// Unified method to handle the selection
- (void) handleSelection:(MaplyBaseViewController *)viewC 
                selected:(NSObject *)selectedObj
{
    // ensure it's a MaplyVectorObject. It should be one of our outlines.
    if ([selectedObj isKindOfClass:[MaplyVectorObject class]])
    {
    MaplyVectorObject *theVector = (MaplyVectorObject *)selectedObj;
    MaplyCoordinate location;

        if ([theVector centroid:&location])
        {
            NSString *title = @"Selected:";
            NSString *subtitle = (NSString *)theVector.userObject;
            [self addAnnotation:title withSubtitle:subtitle at:location];
        }
    }
}

// This is the version for a globe
- (void) globeViewController:(WhirlyGlobeViewController *)viewC 
                    didSelect:(NSObject *)selectedObj
{
    [self handleSelection:viewC selected:selectedObj];
}

// This is the version for a map
- (void) maplyViewController:(MaplyViewController *)viewC 
                    didSelect:(NSObject *)selectedObj
{
    [self handleSelection:viewC selected:selectedObj];
}
{% endhighlight %}

Run that and try selecting a few countries.

![Xcode ViewController.m]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/tutorial/vector_selection_3.png)

Nice, but there were a few moving parts.  Let's look closer.

### Code Breakdown

If you remember the [Vector Data](adding_vector_data.html) tutorial, we added each country outline to the MaplyBaseViewController.  Before we did, we pulled out the _@"ADMIN"_ field and stored that in the MaplyVectorObject userObject field.  We're using that here in the selection delegates.

When the toolkit notices the user selected a feature, it calls the appropriate delegate method and passes in a selected object, which can be any one of the standard Maply objects.  We check for the type and then do something base one that.

In this case we're looking for MaplyVectorObjects and when we see one we consult its userObject.  We happen to know that's an NSString so we figure out the center of the MaplyVectorObject and pop up an annotation with a little bit of info.

That's all there is to it, but it was a lot of code.  Here's a working [ViewController.m]({{ site.baseurl }}/tutorial/code/ViewController_post_vector_selection.m) if you need it.
