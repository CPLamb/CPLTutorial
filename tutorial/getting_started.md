WhirlyGlobe-Maply is an open source toolkit for iOS and Android. You can use it to build an interactive 2D map (Maply) or a 3D globe (WhirlyGlobe).  For more information, check out the [project page]({{ site.baseurl }}/index.html).

In these tutorial we’ll walk you through getting set up with WhirlyGlobe-Maply and displaying some simple data.  By the end you’ll have a simple globe or map based app.  The tutorial is iOS only at the moment.

There are times you’ll need to ender project settings, code, or commands in the Terminal verbatim. They will look like this.

{% highlight bash %}
Enter Precisely This Text
{% endhighlight %}

### Pre-Requisites

You should be familiar with the Terminal in OS X.  You’ll need to type a number of commands to get started.

We make use of [git](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)) and [github](http://github.com/).  A passing familiarity will help.

For iOS development, you’ll need a recent version of [Xcode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xcode).

Xcode 6.1 and WhirlyGlobe­-Maply 2.3 were used to prepare this guide. If you're using a newer version of either, things might be different.
