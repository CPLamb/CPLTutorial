You can make a 3D globe or a 2D map equally well in WhirlyGlobe-Maply.  Hence the name.  Most of the objects are the same and, after a bit of setup, you use them almost identically.  The main difference is the UIViewController.

If you want a rotating globe, you'll want a [WhirlyGlobeViewController](../documentation/2_3/Classes/WhirlyGlobeViewController.html). If you want a slippy map, you'll want a [MaplyViewController](../documentation/2_3/Classes/MaplyViewController.html).

We’ve got both versions right here.  Pick your favorite, map or globe, and then proceed.  The rest of tutorials will work with either and if you’re feeling ambitious you can even make them optional in your own code.
